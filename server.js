Create an EXTREMELY retentive script for a ${duration}-minute ${videoType} video about "${topic}" that guarantees viewers watch until the end.

TARGET: ${audience} | TONE: ${tone} | KEYWORDS: ${keywords || 'N/A'}
${customPrompt ? `SPECIAL INSTRUCTIONS: ${customPrompt}` : ''}

RETENTION SYSTEM REQUIREMENTS:
- Hook must create immediate curiosity gap within 3 seconds
- Use pattern interrupts every 30-45 seconds to reset attention
- Include retention loops ("I'll show you this in just a minute...")
- Build tension and promise resolution throughout
- Use power words and emotional triggers
- Appeal to casual, core, and new viewers simultaneously

SCRIPT STRUCTURE WITH RETENTION TACTICS:

ðŸŽ¯ HOOK (0-15 seconds) - CRITICAL FOR CTR & RETENTION:
- Open with bold statement, shocking statistic, or curiosity gap
- NO introductions yet - dive straight into value
- Create immediate "what happens next?" feeling
- Promise specific, tangible outcome

ðŸ”¥ INTRO (15-45 seconds) - COMMIT VIEWERS:
- Quick personal introduction (credibility)
- Restate the promise with more specificity  
- Preview what's coming ("By the end of this video, you'll know exactly how to...")
- Set expectations and create anticipation

ðŸ“– MAIN CONTENT - RETENTION OPTIMIZED:
Break into 3-4 segments with:
- Cliffhangers between sections
- "But here's what's really interesting..." transitions
- Story loops that get resolved later
- Specific examples and case studies
- "And this next part is crucial..." retention phrases
- Pattern interrupts every 30-45 seconds
- Callbacks to earlier points

ðŸ’¡ REVELATION SECTION (70% through):
- Deliver on main promise
- Include "aha moment" 
- Provide specific, actionable steps
- Use "But wait, there's more..." technique

ðŸš€ CONCLUSION & CTA (Final 15%):
- Summarize key takeaways
- Strong call to action for subscription
- Tease next video content
- End with hook for next video

RETENTION TECHNIQUES TO INCLUDE:
- Open loops: "I'll explain why this matters in just a moment..."
- Pattern interrupts: "But first, let me tell you about..."
- Curiosity gaps: "The real secret is something most people never realize..."
- Social proof: "This helped [specific person] achieve [specific result]..."
- Urgency: "If you don't do this, you'll miss out on..."
- Personal stakes: "When I first discovered this..."

Make this script so engaging that viewers literally cannot stop watching. Every sentence should pull them deeper into the content. Word count: approximately ${parseInt(duration.split('-')[0]) * 150} words.

Act as if you're creating a script that MUST get millions of views and 90%+ retention rate.`;
